<h2>Purpose, Audience, Goal</h2>
<!--Purpose-->
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>By using web development, I intend to give a professional look to one of my favorite hobbies.
    In addition, I will demonstrate my creativity and how well I can apply the skills I have learned from the bootcamp.
    In this way, I will be able to demonstrate to tech companies that I am an effective and creative individual. </p>
<!--Audience-->
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>It is expected that the audience who will view my website will be a potential customer who is interested in my
    photography work. It also could be a potential employer who is interested in my work as a web developer. This will
    allow me to demonstrate my skills in managing and creating a website. There are four target audiences: recruiters,
    hiring managers, peers, and potential customers.</p>
<!--Goal-->
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>A goal of mine is to get into the tech industry and gain as much knowledge as possible so that I can have more
    opportunities as a web developer. My second option would be to work as a freelance developer or have that skill
    in order to improve my service.</p>
