<h1>PWP Milestone 2</h1>

<h3>Welcome Popup Tab</h3>
<p>Whenever someone visits my website, I would like this small window to pop up for them. Additionally,
    this may also contain information about price specials on certain occasions that might be available.
    Basically, this is for the purpose of showing off my frontend skills to let visitors know that I am capable
    of doing certain things in the frontend</p>

<h3>large Image Photography Portfolio</h3>
<p>There will be a slide show showing a selection of my top three favorite photographs at the top of the screen
which is the large image box. A hook or a catch will catch the visitor's attention and this will get their attention.</P>

<h3>Images Box</h3>
<P>I intend to display six of my images on the main webpage. This is to provide a more detailed description of my
    photographic style, as well as a link to view more pictures if the user wishes to view them. As an alternative,
    I would link to make the image pop out or animate that would overlay the background.</P>

<h3>link Box</h3>
<p>Whenever the user clicks on the more images link, a second website will be opened containing a gallery of additional
images. It will provide the user with another link to the home page, which will take them back to the official website from
where the user started.</p>

<h3>Price Box</h3>
<p>There will be a box that will estimate the cost of my work for those visitors who are interested in my work and have
    a guess as to which one I would be willing to do and how much I am willing to charge for it. It is important to note
    that once a user has decided to use my business, my payment methods won't be visible to them. You will simply find a
    message that says cash or check only.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>This will give you a brief idea of who I am. The type of work that I normally do, as well as my skill set, which can
    be photography and web development, as you can see from my website. I would like to mention some reasons why
    they should book me and how long I have been doing this kind of work. Ideally, I want to be able to show off my
    creative style and technology to anyone who visits my site. To show who I am, there will be a picture of me on next
    to about me.</p>

<h3>Contact Form</h3>
<p>There's a contact form where users can send me an email if they want to talk about business or leave feedback on my
    workflow. Also in the footer It would also have a social media button that would take you to my github, Instagram,
    and Twitter accounts. </p>
